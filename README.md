# bench_sampling_matlab_julia_python

This repository contains a set of sampling algorithms implemented in Matlab, Julia and Python for benchmarking.

The goal is to implement the algorithms in a similar straighforward fashion, to 
      
    1. Demonstrate how similar the syntax in the three languages can be.
    2. Test out the effificency of of such algorithms, in standard installations version of Matlab, Julia and Python.

 The goal is NOT to present the most efficient implementation of the algorithms in the three languages (feel free to try though :) )
 
Matlab has been used as the programming langauage of choice at many universities for many years (for engineering, scientific computing, data analysis). Python has gained tremendous popularity in the last 10 years, and many institutions have changed (or are considering to change) from Matlab to using Python. 
Recently Julia has got som attention, as it promises to use a syntax as Matlab, but with the speed of C.
 
Matlab is a commercial product, wheras Python and Julia are released under Open Source licences.
